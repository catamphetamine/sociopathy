/*
Waypoints is a small jQuery plugin that makes it easy to execute a function
whenever you scroll to an element.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints
Documentation and Examples: http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints

Changelog:
	v1.0.2
		- Moved scroll and resize handler bindings out of load.  Should play nicer
		  with async loaders like Head JS and LABjs.
		- Fixed a 1px off error when using certain % offsets.
		- Added unit tests.
	v1.0.1
		- Added $.waypoints('viewportHeight').
		- Fixed iOS bug (using the new viewportHeight method).
		- Added offset function alias: 'bottom-in-view'.
	v1.0 - Initial release.
	
Support:
	- jQuery versions 1.4+
	- IE6+, FF3+, Chrome 6+, Safari 4+, Opera 11
	- Other versions and browsers may work, these are just the ones I've looked at.

		jQuery.fn.waypoint([handler], [options])
		
		handler
			function, optional
			A callback function called when the user scrolls past the element.
			The function signature is function(event, direction) where event is
			a standard jQuery Event Object and direction is a string, either 'down'
			or 'up' indicating which direction the user is scrolling.
			
		options
			object, optional
			A map of options to apply to this set of waypoints, including where on
			the browser window the waypoint is triggered. For a full list of
			options and their defaults, see $.fn.waypoint.defaults.
			
		This is how you register an element as a waypoint. When the user scrolls past
		that element it triggers waypoint.reached, a custom event. Since the
		parameters for creating a waypoint are optional, we have a few different
		possible signatures. Letâ€™s look at each of them.

		someElements.waypoint();
			
		Calling .waypoint with no parameters will register the elements as waypoints
		using the default options. The elements will fire the waypoint.reached event,
		but calling it in this way does not bind any handler to the event. You can
		bind to the event yourself, as with any other event, like so:

		someElements.bind('waypoint.reached', function(event, direction) {
		   // make it rain
		});
			
		You will usually want to create a waypoint and immediately bind a function to
		waypoint.reached, and can do so by passing a handler as the first argument to
		.waypoint:

		someElements.waypoint(function(event, direction) {
		   if (direction === 'down') {
		      // do this on the way down
		   }
		   else {
		      // do this on the way back up through the waypoint
		   }
		});
			
		This will still use the default options, which will trigger the waypoint when
		the top of the element hits the top of the window. We can pass .waypoint an
		options object to customize things:

		someElements.waypoint(function(event, direction) {
		   // do something amazing
		}, {
		   offset: '50%'  // middle of the page
		});
			
		You can also pass just an options object.

		someElements.waypoint({
		   offset: 100  // 100px from the top
		});
			
		This behaves like .waypoint(), in that it registers the elements as waypoints
		but binds no event handlers.

		Calling .waypoint on an existing waypoint will extend the previous options.
		If the call includes a handler, it will be bound to waypoint.reached without
		unbinding any other handlers.

	The default options object that is extended when calling .waypoint. It has the
	following properties:

	offset
		number | string | function
		default: 0
		Determines how far the top of the element must be from the top of the browser
		window to trigger a waypoint. It can be a number, which is taken as a number
		of pixels, a string representing a percentage of the viewport height, or a
		function that will return a number of pixels.
		
	triggerOnce
		boolean
		default: false
		If true, the waypoint will be destroyed when triggered.
	
	An offset of 250 would trigger the waypoint when the top of the element is 250px
	from the top of the viewport. Negative values for any offset work as you might
	expect. A value of -100 would trigger the waypoint when the element is 100px above
	the top of the window.

	offset: '100%'
	
	A string percentage will determine the pixel offset based on the height of the
	window. When resizing the window, this offset will automatically be recalculated
	without needing to call $.waypoints('refresh').

	// The bottom of the element is in view
	offset: function() {
	   return $.waypoints('viewportHeight') - $(this).outerHeight();
	}
	
	Offset can take a function, which must return a number of pixels from the top of
	the window. The this value will always refer to the raw HTML element of the
	waypoint. As with % values, functions are recalculated automatically when the
	window resizes. For more on recalculating offsets, see $.waypoints('refresh').
	
	An offset value of 'bottom-in-view' will act as an alias for the function in the
	example above, as this is a common usage.
	
	offset: 'bottom-in-view'
	
	You can see this alias in use on the Scroll Analytics example page.

	The triggerOnce flag, if true, will destroy the waypoint after the first trigger.
	This is just a shortcut for calling .waypoint('destroy') within the waypoint
	handler. This is useful in situations such as scroll analytics, where you only
	want to record an event once for each page visit.
