(An excerpt from the README.md file)

On Ubuntu Linux:

Download the interactive installation script: 'automation/install.sh'.
Run it as root.
It will download this repository to your machine and will set it up.

On Windows:

Install NginX, Mongodb, Redis, Node.js.
Use the "windows" configuration as a reference.
You may be required to replace the "d:\work\sociopathy" and "d:/work/sociopathy" paths there to your own paths.
And paths to binaries in the *.bat files as well.

Post Installation
========================

Now it's time to run the webserver by executing the 'configuration/ubuntu/run/run.sh' script.

After the webserver starts, go to http://[server's IP address]:8081/
There you should see the welcome page.

Now you should create the administrator user.
Go to http://[server's IP address]:8081/initialize
Edit the administrator user info as you'd like and push the "Create the database" button.
It will initialize the database and redirect you to the login screen.

Now log in with your username and password.
Done.
