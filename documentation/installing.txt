(An excerpt from the README.md file)

On Ubuntu Linux:

Download the interactive installation script: 'automation/install.sh'.
It is supposed to be run as root.
I suggest you execute it by smaller portions (it's not polished yet).
It will download this repository to your machine and will set it up.

If it doesn't work, look at the /home/sociopathy/repository folder.
If the cyrillic filenames are seen as question marks there then you need to turn on utf-8 support (the script says how to do it).

After the installation run the application by executing the 'start.sh' script in your /home/sociopathy directory.
To stop the application use the 'stop.sh' script.
You can update the application with the 'update.sh' script and monitor the resource usage with the 'monitor.sh' script.

You can view the screens with this command (example): 'screen -r sociopathy.node.js' (Press Ctrl + A + D to detach from the screen)
To scroll back the screen, press «Ctrl + A» then «Esc» and then use the cursor keys (up/down). Press «Esc» again to exit the navigation mode.

On Windows:

Install NginX, Mongodb, Redis, Node.js.
Use the "windows" configuration as a reference.
You may be required to replace the "d:\work\sociopathy" and "d:/work/sociopathy" paths there to your own paths.
And paths to binaries in the *.bat files as well.

========================
Post Installation
========================

Now it's time to run the webserver by executing the 'configuration/ubuntu/run/run.sh' script.

After the webserver starts, go to http://[server's IP address]:8081/
There you should see the welcome page.

Now you should create the administrator user.
Go to http://[server's IP address]:8081/initialize
Edit the administrator user info as you'd like and push the "Create the database" button.
It will initialize the database and redirect you to the login screen.

Now log in with your username and password.
Done.
